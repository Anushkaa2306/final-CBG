              At Check Before Go (CBG), we are here to protect you from all these risks. We work only for customers — never for dealers. Our team specializes in independent Pre-Delivery Inspections (PDI) for both private and commercial vehicles. Every inspection comes with a detailed checklist, photos, videos, and OBD/diagnostic scans so you know the exact condition of your vehicle before taking delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              But our service doesn’t stop at inspections. We also provide spare parts — both brand new and quality-tested second-hand parts — for cars, bikes, and commercial vehicles. Whether it’s a small replacement or a major component, we make sure you get genuine, reliable parts at a fair price.
            </p>
